<p>"Make a choice" is difficult, especially there are lots of web technologies, like: PHP, Ruby, JAVA, JavaScript, ASP, and so on.
    You are just blind since each seems good, and each needs time to handle.</p>

<p>I present you <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/" target="_blank">'Node.js'</a>.
    for the following 3 reasons:</p>
<li>It makes JavaScript as a server side language,</li>
<li>It is lightweight and very fast to establish a web server,</li>
<li>Its non-blocking I/O feature makes easier to scale</li>
</br>
<p>Here is a description of Node.js from its site:</br>
    Node.jsÂ® is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime
    for easily building fast, scalable network applications.  Node.js
    uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it
    lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time
    applications that run across distributed devices.
</p>
</br>
<p>And look how fast and easy it establishes a web server:</p>
<pre class="sh_sourceCode"><span class="sh_keyword">var</span> http <span class="sh_symbol">=</span> <span class="sh_function">require</span><span class="sh_symbol">(</span><span class="sh_string">'http'</span><span class="sh_symbol">);</span>
http<span class="sh_symbol">.</span><span class="sh_function">createServer</span><span class="sh_symbol">(</span><span class="sh_keyword">function</span> <span class="sh_symbol">(</span>req<span class="sh_symbol">,</span> res<span class="sh_symbol">)</span> <span class="sh_cbracket">{</span>

<span class="sh_cbracket">}</span><span class="sh_symbol">).</span><span class="sh_function">listen</span><span class="sh_symbol">(</span><span class="sh_number">1337</span><span class="sh_symbol">,</span> <span class="sh_string">'127.0.0.1'</span><span class="sh_symbol">);</span>
console<span class="sh_symbol">.</span><span class="sh_function">log</span><span class="sh_symbol">(</span><span class="sh_string">'Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/'</span><span class="sh_symbol">);</span></pre>

</br>
<p>Node.js is the very raw material, it helps you to solve some fundamental technique issues,
    like: TCP/IP, a server-side coding language based on JavaScript.
    But if you want to establish a http server, you still have a lot of things to do.
    You need a web application framework for Node.js that provides you HTTP fundamentals.
    The framework is out-of-box: <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">'Express.js'</a></p>

<p>'Express.js' provides:</p>
<li>A web application framework,</li>
<li>Http request api,</li>
<li>Http response api,</li>
<li>Http router api,</li>
<li>Middleware supports to allow you inject your codes into http requests and responses.</li>

</br>
<p>We are now having the coding language and the framework technologies.
    We can now develop our web application...... with a text editor?
    Of course, but if you want develop efficiently, you need an IDE.
    Eclipse is not my cup of tea, there is a good IDE for JavaScript, the smartest JavaScript IDE: <a
            href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/index.html" target="_blank">'WebStorm'.</a></p>

</br>
<p>Are HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript enough for the client side coding? Yes, but very raw.
    If you do your work based on these 3 raw technologies,you won't get your web application running after 1 year.
    Thanks for the open-source community,
    you have <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">'Bootstrap'</a> for a good appearance, and
    <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">'AngularJS'</a> for dynamic views.

    </br>
    Both 'Bootstrap'(provided by Twitter) and 'AngularJS'(provided by Google) are big frameworks which need time to handle.
    They are not easier than Node.js or Express.js.
    Hope you already have some knowledge on 'HTTP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript'.
</p>

<p>
    We can use 'WebStorm' to do server-side testing and debug, but what about the client-side testing and debug tools?
    My suggestion is using Chrome Developer Tools. It is good enough: doing CSS adjustment in a WYSIWYG way, and debug JavaScript on-hands.
</p>

</br>
<p>One more thing: how to persist the data? </br>
    This is not a question 5 years ago, but a difficult choice nowadays.
    Since the NoSQL trends, we now have a lot of DB technologies:
</p>
<li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">'MongoDB'</a>,
    a Document-Oriented storage in JSON-style. Seems to be a good companion with Node.js.</li>
<li><a href="http://memcached.org/" target="_blank">'Memcached'</a>,
    a Key-Value in-memory storage caching system, but not persists data.</li>
<li><a href="http://redis.io/" target="_blank">'Redis'</a>,
    a Key-Value in-memory storage  system which persists data. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">'MySQL'</a>,
    The most popular open-source RDS.</li>
<p>What are my choices? It took me 1 week to make the decision: 'MySql' and 'Memcached'.
    'MongoDB' is indeed a good companion with Node.js with its JSON-stype storage(without data conversion in Node.js).
    But the schema change is not smooth, and loses data!
    So I design a new data schema based on RDS which is described in Chapter 04.</br>
    'Redis' is too big compared with 'Memcached',
    I need a lightweight cache system which data persistence is not necessarily.
</p>

</br>
<p>Already a lot of technologies, frameworks, and tools, aren't they? But still not enough.
    Here are some others which are also very useful and necessary, just name a few:
</p>
<li><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">'GitHub'</a>,
    Your code repository.</li>
<li><a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">'Bower'</a>,
    JavaScript package management tool.</li>
<li><a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/" target="_blank">'Mocha'</a>,
    JavaScript unit testing framework.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql/" target="_blank">'node-mysql'</a>,
    A pure node.js JavaScript Client implementing the MySql protocol.</li>
<li><a href="http://passportjs.org/" target="_blank">'Passport.js'</a>,
    A authentication middleware for Node.js.</li>
<li><a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/" target="_blank">'AngularUI'</a>,
    The companion suites to AngularJS framework.</li>
<li><a href="http://underscorejs.org/" target="_blank">'UnderScore.js'</a>,
    A JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects.</li>

</br>
<p>Hope you are not scared! Now we can really start to develop our web application. Go to chapter 03:

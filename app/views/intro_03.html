<p>Almost every web application needs user authentication.</br>
    Authentication is an absolutely essential element of a typical security model.
    It is the process of confirming the identification of a user (or in some cases, a machine)
    that is trying to log on or access resources. There are a number of different authentication mechanisms,
    but all serve this same purpose.
</p>

<p>Like just now, you provide your email and password to enter 'Darkhouse'.
    This authentication mechanism is so-called 'Form-based Authentication'.
    Besides, there are 'Http Basic Authentication', 'Http Digest Authentication',
    'Certificate Authentication', 'OpenID', 'OAuth', 'SSO', and so on.
</p>
<p>
<b>If you are serious about 'Security', then you must have a solid understanding of authentication methods.</b>
</p>
<p>'Security' is the pandora box that I have opened.
    Let's start from the 'Form-based Authentication'. I will describe the 'Darkhouse' authentication workflow
    and figure out the difference between Singl-Page-Application and Normal-Website.
</p>

<h3>Single Page Application:</h3>
<img src="images/auth_spa.png" class="img-responsive">
<ol>
    <li>Your email and password are sent to the server using RESTful API.</li>
    <li>The server gets the email and password, compared them with the data stored in DB.</li>
    <li>If the comparison is passed, the server create a session cookie
        and return the user information to the client.</li>
    <li>The client receives the JSON-style user information, and routes to the correct views.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Versus Normal Website:</h3>
<img src="images/auth_normal.png" class="img-responsive">
<ol>
    <li>Your email and password are sent to the server using http-post.</li>
    <li>The server gets the email and password, compared them with the data stored in DB.</li>
    <li>If the comparison is passed, the server create a session cookie
        and return the HTML page to the client.</li>
    <li>The client receives and renders the HTML.</li>
</ol>

<p>The main difference is SPA composes the HTML page on client-side, while normal website is on the server-side.
   So in SPA scenario, we do not base the security on URLs, but on REST Web Services. Almost all the HTML, CSS,
    and JavaScript have already been downloaded to the client browser at first time. Continues client-server
    communications are mainly on JSON-style messages. This feature makes SPA more like a native APP which
    has a good torrance on bad network.
</p>

<p>In a typical web application, the credentials used to authenticate a user will only be transmitted
    during the login request. If authentication succeeds, a session will be established and maintained
    via a cookie set in the user's browser.
    <pre>
    <comment>Your current session cookie in your browser:</comment>
    sessionID = {{sessionCookie}}
   </pre>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Please try to refresh this page</b>,
    and you will find 'DarkHouse' do not want your credentials again. What happened
    during the refresh?
<ol>
    <li>The 'sessionID' cookie is sent to the server.</li>
    <li>The server gets the cookie and decrypt it. </li>
    <li>The server using the decrypt key to found the corresponding user session stored in Node.js process memory.</li>
    <li>If the session is valid, de-serialize the user session into full user information,
        for example, search DB by the username to get other information.</li>
    <li>The server return the full user information to the client.</li>
    <li>The client receives the '200' status and the full user information.</li>
    <li>The client continues the routes and operation.</li>
</ol>

    The session mechanism is complicate yet very necesailly. It is very difficult to
    build the authentication and session framework all by yourself.
    Instead, I found  2 existing frameworks that supports.
    Even though, it took me 2 weeks to get through.
    <li><a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session" target="_blank">'express-session'</a>
        A http session framework build on expressjs.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://passportjs.org/" target="_blank">'Passport'</a>
        A authentication middleware for Node.js combined with express-session. </li>

    'express-session' supports external session stores like 'Memcached'. In the above workflow, step 3, the session
     information can be stored to 'Memcached' which allows more session information be stored in memory and be shared
     with other Node.js processes(This is very important).
</p>
<p> It is easy to confuse authentication with authorization.
    While authentication verifies the userâ€™s identity,
    authorization verifies that the user in question has the correct permissions and rights
    to access the requested resource.
    The two always work together. Authentication occurs first, then authorization.
    <b>'DarkHouse' will utilize its authorization framework based on 'Memcached'.</b></p>

<p>
    The user authentication and authorization will be the corner stone of 'DarkHouse'.
    Future APPs will either inherit or based on it. Besides lots of framework
    and client-side developments, the data model needs to be confirmed first.

    data model for all objects.

<p>If you want to compose a web application, you must consider following stuff:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The client side technology,</li>
    <li>The server side technology,</li>
    <li>The data persistent technology.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>But if you want to do better, you should also think about:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Which is the fastest way to get through?</li>
    <li>How to get a state-of-art UI?</li>
    <li>Is there a way to fit all the screen resolution?</li>
    <li>What is the best server technology which provides good performance yet low cost?</li>
    <li>Which data persistent method do I need?</li>
    <li>How to build a re-usable framework with good modularization?</li>
    <li>How about the security problem?</li>
    <li>How can I find all these technologies and compose them into a monolith?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Bringing those questions, let's build a web application from scratch(real scratch).
    We should first know something about the modern web development technologies and tools.
